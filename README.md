# InstaFlick
 InstaFlick is a simple yet intuitive web application; integrated with Instagram and Flicker APIs, to fetch images using Tags, Names, and Locations. 
 
# What You Need
 All you need to do is add your own style sheets and javascript or jQuery codes if you want to enhance the look and feel. I did not include my own styles
 because I know we have our own style of designing apps. So you are free to create your own style and effects to it. Also, you are free modify the code as 
 long as you will abide with the MIT license.
